# Godot Vector Sprite

Zoom sprites to infinity and beyond!

Some people's childhood memories are filled with pixelated graphics.
Mario jumping over mushrooms, Sonic running through loops, and Link slashing bushes.

My childhood memories revolve around (then) Macromedia Flash ... those were the days.
Here is my attempt to rid the Godot Engine of those pixelated graphics and
bring vector sprites to the forefront.

Import SVG files and use them as sprites in your game. Transform, animate, and scale 
them without losing quality.
