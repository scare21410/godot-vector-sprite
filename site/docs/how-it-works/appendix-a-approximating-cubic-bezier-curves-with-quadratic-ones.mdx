## Fast, precision driven, piecewise degree reduction of cubic Bezier

**In plain-speak translation: convert cubic Bezier to a chain of quadratic Bezier segments,
with a precision at your choice.**

Interested? Continue reading, you can check your email or play [bingo later](#), there's a long way
to discover why and how.

## Abstract

The overall problem approached by the article is:

**within a defined degree of precision, approximate a cubic Bezier curve:**

1. **by one quadratic Bezier or**
2. **if the first approach is not possible, find a division of the cubic such as each of the
   resulted curve segments can be approximated by quadratics.**

The article presents some preliminary analysis of the problem and introduces the
definition a cubic's Bezier zero-approximation and one-approximation quadratics,
as the quadratics that approximates the best a cubic Bezier for values of the $t$
parameter closer to 0 and 1 respectively.
The distance between the control points of the 0- and 1-approximation quadratics is calculated,
as it plays an important role in adaptive subdivision of a cubic Bezier.

The article introduces a measure of dissimilarity between two parametric curves and used
this measure as the defect of approximation of a cubic Bezier by a quadratic one.
Three special quadratics are analyzed in the light of this approximation defect,
one of them - the mid-point approximation - showing good potential in solving the problem.

The mid-point approximation is used, in conjunction with subdivision of a cubic Bezier
in two halves, to give a first solution to the problem - the mid-point half-splitting method;
the method uses simple arithmetic for the approximation, being a very low computational expensive one.

Further, the article presents an important property of the distance between the
control points of the 0- and 1- approximation quadratics for the first segment
resulted by a subdivision of a cubic at an arbitrary value $t_{\text{split}}$ for
the cubic Bezier's parameter: this distance varies with $t_{\text{split}}^3$.
This allows the approach the subdivision in a true adaptive way, choosing better (and fewer)
division points than in the case of half-splitting method, the price to be paid being the
computation of a square and a cubic root at each subdivision iteration. The method is further
refined such as the square and cubic root computation is required only every two
subdivision iterations.

As usual, the article is supported by interactive java applets, so please feel free to
interact and modify any of the configuration presented, by click-n-dragging any of the
points represented by small **squares** (note :diamond shaped points are for position marking
purposes only - use the square handles). The applets are compiled using **Java 1.4**,
but a Java Runtime Environment as low as **ver. 1.2** should be sufficient to run them.

## Quick tests for cubic to quadratic conversion

A quadratic Bezier can always be represented by a cubic one by applying the degree elevation
algorithm. The resulting cubic representation will share its anchor points with the original
quadratic, while the control points will be at $2/3$ of the quadratic handle segments:

$$
\mathbf{C}_1 = \frac{2\mathbf{C} + \mathbf{P}_1}{3} \\
\mathbf{C}_2 = \frac{2\mathbf{C} + \mathbf{P}_2}{3}
$$

As expected, *not always* a cubic Bezier curve can be represented exactly by a quadratic one.
Here are some consequences of the 3rd degree term of a cubic Bezier:

1. A cubic Bezier may have inflection points. A quadratic has a constant bending direction
  (*thus, no inflection points*).
2. A cubic Bezier may display a loop (recurve behavior)[^1]. *A quadratic never recurve*.

A quick test of whenever the approximation of cubic to a quadratic Bezier is possible or not
would *primarily address the differences above*. I feel that it is possible to obtain some
formulae to implement the tests above (in fact, the case of inflexion points
[was addressed previously](http://www.caffeineowl.com/graphics/2d/vectorial/cubic-inflexion.html)),
but such tests would not be too useful for our goals as they require a non-trivial computational effort.

## Magnitude of the 3rd degree term of a cubic Bezier

A [previous article](http://www.caffeineowl.com/graphics/2d/vectorial/cubic-inflexion.html#formula)
brought the parametric expression of a cubic Bezier under the form:

$$
\mathbf{P}(t) = \mathbf{P}_1 + 3 t (\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1) + 3 t^2 (\mathbf{C}_2 - 2 \mathbf{C}_1 + \mathbf{P}_1) + t^3 (\mathbf{P}_2 - 3\mathbf{C}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1)
$$

Now, if the magnitude of the 3rd degree term is *small enough* (ideally zero),
the cubic can be approximated by a quadratic.

In fact, the 3rd degree term expresses the distance between the points corresponding
to the same value of the parameter $t$, one on the cubic and the other on the quadratic
obtained by canceling the 3rd degree term of the cubic. This distance will be:

$$
t^3 \cdot |\mathbf{P}_2 - 3\mathbf{C}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1| \qquad \mathbf{(2)}
$$

where $|v|$ denotes the modulus of $v$ (i.e., $\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}$). The maximum distance
is obtained for $t = 1$ and is $|\mathbf{P}_2 - 3\mathbf{C}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1|$.

**Canceling the 3rd degree term of a cubic will result in a quadratic approximation
of the original cubic; the magnitude of the 3rd degree coefficient acts as the
precision of approximation.**

It is worth noting that the quadratic approximation will share its starting anchor point with the
original cubic, *but not its end point* (unless the cubic can be exactly approximated by the quadratic).
The following explores the properties of the quadratic obtained by canceling the 3rd degree term.

  )}
/>
(applet code=com.caffeineowl.cubic2quad.ThirdDegreeCancelationApplet)

We'll start by computing the positions of the:

- the control point $C'$ *and*
- the end anchor point $P'_2$

of the quadratic Bezier obtained by canceling the 3rd degree term of the original cubic.
The parametric expression of this quadratic is:
$$
\mathbf{Q}'(t) = \mathbf{P}_1 + 2 t (\mathbf{C}' - \mathbf{P}_1) + t^2 (\mathbf{P}'_2 - 2 \mathbf{C}' + \mathbf{P}_1) \qquad (3)
$$

By equaling the 1st and 2nd degree term coefficients of the relation above with the one
parametric expression of the original cubic, one can derive the position of control and end
points of the quadratic approximation as:
$$
\mathbf{C}' = \frac{3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1}{2} \\
\mathbf{P}'_2 = \mathbf{P}_1 - 3\mathbf{C}_1 + 3\mathbf{C}_2
$$

The applet above depicts in yellow this quadratic. One can note that:

1. It is the start end[^2] of the original cubic that is the best approximated by this quadratic.
   The worst approximated is the finish end of the cubic. \
   **Definition:** the quadratic obtained by canceling the 3rd degree term of a cubic
   Bezier will be called, in the followings, the **_0_ (zero)-approximation quadratic;**

2. For the zero-approximation quadratic:
   - The start anchor point is common with the start anchor of the approximated cubic
   - The control point is outer of the first cubic handle segment and one and a half
     the distance between the anchor point and the first control point of the original cubic. \
     The expression of the control point of the zero-approximation quadratic is
     $$\mathbf{C}' = \frac{3 \mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1}{2} = \left(1 - \frac{3}{2}\right) \mathbf{P}_1 + \frac{3}{2} \mathbf{C}_1$$
   - The end of the zero-approximation quad is at the point with the position given by $$\mathbf{P}'_2 = \mathbf{P}_1 - 3\mathbf{C}_1 + 3\mathbf{C}_2.$$

   **Note:** that the finish anchor point of the cubic is not involved in any of the above relations,
   therefore the 0-approximating quadratic can't be expected to deliver a good approximation
   near the finish anchor point (just modify the position of the finish anchor
   point - $P_2$ - in the applet below to see that the 0-approximating quadratic - in yellow - does
   not change)

(applet code=com.caffeineowl.cubic2quad.ThirdDegreeCancelationApplet)

The same reasoning can be performed for the other end of the cubic Bezier, resulting in
a quadratic that will start in the $P_2$ anchor point, will have the control point in the
location given by $C'' = (3C_2 â P_2)/2$ and the second anchor point will be at the
location given by $P''_1 = P_2 â 3C_2 + 3C_1$.
This quadratic, which I'll name the **1(one)-approximation quadratic** from now on, will
approximate better the original cubic for values of the parameter $t$ closer to 1 and
worse for values closer to 0.
The applet on the left depicts both of these quadratics approximating the initial cubic,
with the 0-approximating quadratic drawn in yellow and the
[psychedelic purple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_(color)#Psychedlic_Purple) for the
1-approximating quadratic.

It is interesting to note that:

1. The distance between the control points of 0- and 1-approximation quadratic is
$$
\begin{align*}
D_{0-1} &= |\mathbf{C}' - \mathbf{C}''| = \frac{|\mathbf{P}_2 - 3\mathbf{C}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1|}{2} \quad (*)
\end{align*}
$$

2. The maximum distance between two points:
   - considered for the same value of parameter $t$ ...
   - one on the cubic and the other one on any of the zero- or one-approximating quadratics

   is twice the distance between the control points of the 0- and 1-approximation quadratic (see above):
   $|\mathbf{P}_2 - 3\mathbf{C}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1|$ (just use **(2)** with $t = 1$).

   **$D_{0-1}$** - It seems that the distance between the control points of the zero- and
   one-approximation (denoted for the followings with **$D_{0-1}$**) gives an indication about
   the chance of approximating a cubic by a single quadratic: the closer to 0 the better the
   chance to find such an approximation.

## Defect of approximating a cubic by a quadratic

To measure how good the approximation of a cubic by a quadratic is, I'll define a distance[^3]
between two parametric curves as *the maximum distance between the points on the two curves
that corresponds to the same value of the parameter $t$*. Of course, the definition supposes
that the two parametric curves are defined for a variation of the parameter in the same range
(i.e., 0..1).

The distance defined above acts as a measure of *dissimilarity* between the two parametric curves.
With this definition, one can measure the quality of an approximation by how *low* this distance is.
If this distance vanishes, the two curves will be identical, in both the shape *and the mode* in
which they are traversed[^4].

In the context of approximating a cubic Bezier with a quadratic one, the distance between the
original cubic and its approximation will be named in the followings
**the defect of the approximation**.

Examples:

1. The defect of approximating a cubic by its *0*-approximation quadratic will be
   $|\mathbf{P}_2 - 3\mathbf{C}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1|$
   (obtained for a $t$ parameter value of 1)
2. Similarly, the defect of approximating a cubic by its *1*-approximation quadratic will be
   $|\mathbf{P}_2 - 3\mathbf{C}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1|$ (obtained for a $t$ = 1)

## In the search for the perfect approximation

As seen above, using only one of the cubic anchors in the quadratic approximation leads to
less precise approximation. What if trying quadratic approximations that shares both ends with
the cubic to approximate?

The defect of approximating a cubic curve by a quadratic *sharing the anchor points with the
original cubic* and having **C** as the position of its control point, is given by the expression[^5]:
<a name="formula4"></a>
$$
t (1 - t) |2\mathbf{C} - 3\mathbf{C}_1 + \mathbf{P}_1 + 3t (\mathbf{P}_2 - 3\mathbf{C}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1)| \qquad (4)
$$

(applet code=com.caffeineowl.cubic2quad.CubicApprox01Applet)

The applet on the left explores how the distance modeling the defect of approximation varies
for the following particular cases, all of them being considered for quadratics that share the
ends with the cubic Bezier. Displayed in red is the segment between two points
(one on the cubic the other on the approximating quadratic) corresponding to the same of the
$t$ parameter (adjustable using the slider below the applet):

- [configuration 1](javascript:setLevel('zero', 1) "Display 0-approximation quad") -
  the control point of the approximating quadratic is at the location of the control of
  the 0-approximation quadratic;
- [configuration 2](javascript:setLevel('one', 2) "Display 1-approximation quad") - the control
  point of the approximating quadratic is at the location of the 1-approximation control;
- [configuration 3](javascript:setLevel('mid', 4) "Display 'mid'-approximation quad") - the
  control point of the approximating quadratic is at middle of the segment between the
  0-approximation and the 1-approximation quadratics.

One can note that, when the control is chosen as at mid-distance between 0-approximation
and 1-approximation quad controls (the 3<sup>rd</sup> cfg above), the approximating
quad and the cubic look like they are sharing their mid-points.

A more in-depth exploration is possible by applying [formula (4)](#formula4) for the three
configuration above and studying the distance between two points, that corresponds to the
same value of the $t$ parameter, one of each on the cubic the other on the quadratic.
The applet below assists this exploration; the chart at the applet's bottom displays the
distance between the two points (one on cubic the other on the approximating quadratic).
Play with the cubic and quadratic points, but expect that a cubic displaying inflexion
points or recurve behavior never to have a good quadratic approximation.

(applet code=com.caffeineowl.cubic2quad.GeneralDefectApplet.class)

- [configuration 1](javascript:setLevel('defect1', 1)) - the case of approximation of a cubic by a
quadratic that shares the anchor points with the cubic and has the same control point as the
0-approximation quadratic ($\mathbf{C} = \frac{3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1}{2}$), leads to the
defect of approximation be the maximum of the expression:
$$
t^2 (1 - t) |\mathbf{P}_2 - 3\mathbf{C}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1|
$$

This maximum is:
$$
\frac{4}{27} |\mathbf{P}_2 - 3\mathbf{C}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1| \qquad (5)
$$

obtained for the $t$ parameter value of $\frac{2}{3}$

- [configuration 2](javascript:setLevel('defect2', 2)) - the approximation using the control of the 1-approximation quadratic will have the same defect, obtained for a $t$ parameter value of $\frac{1}{3}$;
- [configuration 3](javascript:setLevel('defect0', 0)) - the quadratic approximation having the control point at mid-distance between the control points of *0-* and 1-approximation quadratics ($\mathbf{C} = \frac{3\mathbf{C}_2 - \mathbf{P}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1}{4}$) and the same anchor points as the original cubic, formula (3) above leads to an approximation defect of only:

$$
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{18} D_{0-1} \qquad (6)
$$

obtained for a $t$ parameter value of $\frac{1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}{2}$ or
$\frac{1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}}{2}$

Another interesting fact is that the above defined quadratic has its "mid-point" on the same
location as the "mid-point" of the cubic: $(\mathbf{P}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_1 + \mathbf{P}_1)/8$
(simply use $(3\mathbf{C}_2 - \mathbf{P}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1)/4$ as the position
of the control point in the formula for the
[mid point of a quadratic](http://www.caffeineowl.com/graphics/2d/vectorial/bezierintro.html#midQuad)).

The third configuration seems particularly promising: the defect of the approximation is less than
10% of the $D_{0-1}$. For this reason, it is worth bearing a name: in short,
this approximation will be called the **mid-point approximation** for the rest of the article.

I haven't discovered an analytic way to prove it, but it seems the mid-point approximation
(the 3rd configuration) is the best. Or is it? Well, not quite so: here is one
[configuration](javascript:setLevel('defect3', 3)) that doesn't, and another one [here](javascript:setLevel('defect4', 4))
(hint: establish any of the two configurations then click on the
[configuration 3](javascript:setLevel('defect0prime', 0));
notice the defect being reported as smaller for cfg 3, even if the approximation is visibly
worse than the initial one). For the special case of the last two configurations shown,
the problem stays in the way the defect is defined: it keeps track not only on shape of the curve,
but the way in which it is traversed as well.

Well, maybe the perfect approximation wasn't found, but let's see what's the good side of what
*was* found so far. Particularly, focusing on equation (6), one may note that:

- the computation of the approximation defect is pretty inexpensive: if one will rely,
  when comparing the defect with the desired precision, on the square of distances instead
  of the distances themselves the computation involves only basic arithmetic;
- using a strong criterion will result in the approximation (if any) being of good quality
- however strong, the mid-point approximation seems to be a quite permissive one:
  one can be sure that *the mid-point approximation is good enough if the distance between
  the control points of 0- and 1-approximation quadratics*
  (**$D_{0-1}$** = $|\mathbf{P}_2 - 3\mathbf{C}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1|/2$)
  *is approximately **10 times greater than the acceptable defect*** (*$\sqrt{3}/18 \lt 0.096$*).

## Quadratic approximation of a cubic Bezier by half-splitting

For the cases the cubic cannot be reasonably approximated by a single quadratic, one can try to
divide the cubic into more than one segments that **can** be better approximated by quadratics.

- subdivide the cubic in two "halves"
- assess the precision of the quadratic approximation: if not good enough,
  continue the sub-division.

(applet code=com.caffeineowl.cubic2quad.CubicToQuadDivisionApplet1.class)

The applet on the left implements the above, using the mid-point approximation at the second step:
the slider allows the adjustment of the desired precision (in the range of 0.01-100 points).
As expected, the lesser the tolerance, the more divisions required.

What about the inflexion points, how the algorithm above deals with them? Well, simply by
dividing the cubic around the inflexion point until it becomes so flat it can be approximated
with a pretty flat quadratic. Here's [a configuration](javascript:quadByDiv.setMode(1)) that
shows this effect: for the start, reduce the required precision to over 10 points value for
the accepted defect. Notice that the cubic segment, even exposing one inflexion point,
will be approximated by a single quadratic segment. Imagine the scale reduced tenfold and
you'll find the approximation to be a pretty good one.

Now, with the same configuration and required precision, mark the "Detect inflexion" check-box:
this will detect the inflexion point, divide the cubic first at this point and apply the algorithm
on the two resulted cubic segments. By doing so, the resulted approximation will be more precise,
since the algorithm will be required to approximate only cubic segments with constant bending direction.
Granted, dividing first the cubic in its inflexion point *may* result in increasing the number of
quadratic segments, and most of the times this will be the result: more quadratic segments and
a better approximation.
But there are configurations for which the division in the inflexion points will decrease
the number of resulted quadratic segments, without impacting on the precision of the approximation.
For example, for *a required precision of 0.5*, this [configuration](javascript:quadByDiv.setMode(2))
will require less quadratic segments if first divided at the inflexion point position:
establish 0.5 for the precision and toggle on and off the "Detect inflexion" check-box.
However, when using the inflexion points detection, the very [same configuration](javascript:quadByDiv.setMode(2))
performs worse in the number of quadratic segments if the required precision is extremely high
(try *0.01*, which is $10^{-4}$ â $10^{-5}$ of the maximum curve extension).

## Quadratic approximation of a cubic Bezier by adaptive division

The algorithm of halving the cubic until the segments can be reasonably approximated by
a quadratic is easy to implement and requires low computation effort. However, it simply
does not attempt to exploit the cubic characteristics, but only to adjust to them,
resulting in a possible higher than necessary number of segments.

The idea behind adaptive division is:

- consider a division point at the maximum value of $t$ *for which the first cubic segment can
  still be approximated by a quadratic* within the required precision;
- repeat the previous step for the remaining of the cubic.

If the first step can be easily achieved, one can expect fewer quadratic segments to result in
approximation.

Let's try to use the mid-point approximation with this, knowing that the precision of the
approximation is governed by the distance between the control points of the
0- and 1-approximation quadratics **$D_{0-1}$**.
Suppose that a cubic Bezier defined by the points $P_1$, $C_1$, $C_2$ and $P_2$ is
subdivided at a parameter value of $t_{\text{split}}$. Well, if one cares to calculate
the distance between the 0- and 1-quadratic approximation for *the first cubic
segment* â $d_{0-1}^1(t)$, a nice surprise awaits[^6]. For the impatient, here is the spoiler:
$$
d_{0-1}^1(t_{\text{split}}) = t_{\text{split}}^3 \cdot \frac{|\mathbf{P}_2 - 3\mathbf{C}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1|}{2} = t_{\text{split}}^3 \cdot D_{0-1} \qquad (6)
$$

Now, the formula **(6)** is quite remarkable[^6]: it simply states that the distance between
the control points of 0- and 1-approximations for the first cubic segment obtained by subdividing a
cubic Bezier at a value $t_{\text{split}}$ of the parameter simply varies with the cube
of $t_{\text{split}}$. It is so simple that allows the following approach when attempting to
approximate a cubic Bezier by a daisy-chain of quadratics when imposing a maximum tolerance
of *prec*:

(applet code=com.caffeineowl.cubic2quad.CubicToQuadDivisionApplet1.class)

1. Compute the distance **$D_{0-1}$** between the control points of 0- and 1-approximation
   quadratics (use [formula *](#pseudoQuadDist))
2. Compute $t_{\text{max}}$ as the root of equation: \
   $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{18} D_{0-1} t_{\text{max}}^3 = \text{prec}$
3. If $t_{\text{max}}$ is less than 1.0:
   * Subdivide the cubic at $t_{\text{max}}$
   * Approximate the first segment using mid-point approximation
   * Enter again the first step with the second cubic segment
4. If $t_{\text{max}}$ is greater than 1.0, the cubic Bezier can be directly approximated by
   the mid-point approximation within the specified tolerance (i.e., use mid-point approximation
   and exit the cycle)

The applet on the left implements the above algorithm, which I'd like to call the "simple adaptive
division using mid-point approximation".

Note that, concerning the computational cost, the adaptive division requires higher cost
*per division* than the half-splitting one: the division effort and the computation of
the **$D_{0-1}$** distance is pretty much the same, but the adaptive division requires the
computation of a square root (at step 1) and a cubic root (at step 2). The only chance of
having the adaptive division performing better concerning the computational effort is to
have a significant reduction in the number of required divisions (number of resulted segments).

But let us postpone a while the comparison in the number of resulted segments. Please note
first that the adaptive division algorithm above remains the same if one substitutes
$t$ with $1 - t$ (i.e., the cubic is explored backwards). Therefore, running through
step 1 and 2, one finds not one but two division points, corresponding to $t_{\text{max}}$
and $1 - t_{\text{max}}$ (adaptive symmetric division). This means:

- One can pay the cost of computing the square root and cubic root *only once per two divisions*
- The 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> steps are to be replaced with:
  1. If $t_{\text{max}}$ is less than *0.5*:
     - Subdivide the cubic at $t_{\text{max}}$ and $1 - t_{\text{max}}$
     - Approximate the first segment and third segments using mid-point approximation
     - Enter again the first step with the second (mid) cubic segment
  2. If the resulted $t_{\text{max}}$ is greater than *0.5*, divide the cubic in two halves and
     use the mid-point approximation for each of them and terminate. This is because the first
     and third quad segments will overlap, letting no room for the second/mid segment.
  3. If the resulted $t_{\text{max}}$ is greater than 1.0, simply use the mid-point approximation
     and terminate, because the cubic can be approximated by a single quadratic segment within
     the specified precision.

Not only this will save some computational effort, but in some cases the approximation is
slightly better: the division points are more equally distributed along the initial cubic Bezier.

Finally, concerning the number of resulted segments: I didn't run (yet) the adaptive division
algorithm(s) on a randomly generated set of cubics to extract statistical data, but my explorations
suggest that the adaptive division performs 0%-45% better than the half-splitting one
(both using the mid-point approximation).
One may find here an [applet can be used to explore the performance of the 3 algorithms]
(javascript:popUpWindow('./cubic2quad02.html', 20, 20, 740, 640))
(half-split, simple adaptive and symmetric adaptive) in terms of the number of quadratic segments
used in subdivision.

## Conclusion

The article presented:

1. A measure of dissimilarity between two parametric curves
2. A very simply to compute, yet a fairly good approximation of a cubic segment by a quadratic one:
   the mid-point approximation quadratic, sharing the anchor points with the cubic Bezier and with
   the control point at the mid-distance between the control points of zero- and one approximation:
   $\mathbf{C} = \frac{3\mathbf{C}_2 - \mathbf{P}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1}{4}$.
   The approximation is very easy to compute, requiring only arithmetic operations
   (even better, addition/subtraction/bit-shifting are sufficient if only positive integer operands
   are assumed);
3. The defect of approximating a cubic segment by the mid-point quadratic segment:
   $\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{36}\right)|\mathbf{P}_2 - 3\mathbf{C}_2 + 3\mathbf{C}_1 - \mathbf{P}_1|$;
4. The half-splitting mid-point algorithm to subdivide a cubic Bezier until the resulted segments
   can be approximated by quadratics Bezier within an imposed precision. The advantage is the
   simplicity of implementation and a small computational effort;
5. Two adaptive algorithms to subdivide a cubic Bezier such that the resulted segments can be
   approximated by quadratics Bezier within an imposed precision. This one has the advantage of
   generating a smaller number of segments, possibly[^7] with the price of slighter increase in
   the computational effort.

[^1]: **Note:** I reckon that a proper demonstration for the statement "if a cubic Bezier displays a
      recurve behavior, then the curve's handle segments intersect" is possible. I feel that is
      possible to find other necessary conditions for a cubic Bezier to display recurve behavior,
      conditions that are stronger but still computational easy. Though, as I said, I don't really
      have time for the dig, and besides presenting them would be are out of the scope of the
      present article.

[^2]: **Note:** the quadratic Bezier obtained in this way is the 2nd degree truncation of the
      Taylor "series" of the original cubic around $t = 0$ (yeah ...right... - a series with 3
      terms only). It's quite natural to offer a better approximation near the starting end of
      the cubic and the worst one for the finish end.

[^3]: **Note:** it can be shown that the definition above describes a distance:
      - $dist(\textbf{u}, \textbf{v}) >= 0$ and $dist(\textbf{u}, \textbf{v}) = 0$
        if and only when $\textbf{u} = \textbf{v}$
      - $dist(\textbf{u}, \textbf{v}) = dist(\textbf{v}, \textbf{u})$
      - $|\textbf{u} - \textbf{v}| <= |\textbf{u} - \textbf{w}| + |\textbf{w} - \textbf{v}|$
        (the triangle inequality)

[^4]: **Note:** because the definition also includes *the mode in which the parametric curves
      are traversed*, it acts as a very strong criterion of the way in which one curve approximates
      the other. As an example, the curves:
      $$
      \begin{align*}
      C_1(t) &= (x(t) = \cos(t),\ y(t) = \sin(t)) \qquad and \\
      C_2(t) &= (x(t) = -\cos(t),\ y(t) = -\sin(t))
      \end{align*}
      $$
      are both describing *the same shape* (unit-radius circle), but the distance defined previously
      will be always 2 (the length of the diameter).

[^5]: **Note:** the expression was obtained by considering the parametric expressions for a cubic and
      a quadratic that share the same anchor points. The calculus can be laborious if done by paper
      and pencil. Fortunately, there are tools for symbolic calculus; personally, I used a trial
      version of MuPad from [SciFace](http://www.sciface.com/) - same result quicker and with no
      financial pressure on my budget.

[^6]: Note: so simple that, after performing the calculus using MuPad, I couldn't believe my eyes
      and went into doing it by hand, which I wouldn't advise anyone to repeat unless one has a
      sick pleasure in performing long calculations with pen-and-paper. My advice: better use
      the spoiler and be convinced of this result by seeing it used in the implementation of
      the interactive applets.

[^7]: Note: the increase in effort is very much dependent on the platform used for performing
      the computation: for a math library using directly the CPU's floating point unit, there is
      likely to pay pretty much the same price due to the reduction in the number of quadratic
      segments required for a decent approximation.
