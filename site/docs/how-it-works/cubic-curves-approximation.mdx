Because the illustration programs such as Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape use cubic Bézier curves
to draw curves, we need to "downgrade" them to quadratic Bézier curves to be able to draw them.
Unfortunately cubic Bézier curves cannot be expressed as a quadratic Bézier curve exactly.
We need to approximate them and make sure the approximation is good enough for our purposes.

Out first attempt is to use the reversal of elevation of the quadratic Bézier curve to
cubic Bézier curve. Elevation of a quadratic Bézier curve to a cubic Bézier curve is
always possible using the following formula:

$$
\begin{align*}
Q_0 &= P_0 \\
Q_1 &= \frac{1}{3} P_0 + \frac{2}{3} P_1 \\
Q_2 &= \frac{2}{3} P_1 + \frac{1}{3} P_2 \\
Q_3 &= P_2
\end{align*}
$$

However, when trying to reverse the process, we get two different values for the control point:

$$
\begin{align*}
P_1 &= \frac{3}{2} Q_1 - \frac{1}{2} Q_0 \\
P_1 &= \frac{3}{2} Q_2 - \frac{1}{2} Q_3
\end{align*}
$$
